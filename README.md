# DDAPROJECT

This project was an insight into the potential application of a DDA systems, focused on behaviour trees as a method of controlling the difiiculty curve. The project was also used to test the validity and effectiveness of a DDA system on a player depending on the players perception of a DDA system being active.

For this project the design elements were kept simple to avoid influencing players perception of ingame events and as such features minimal visual elements. The focus of this project was spent developing a dynamic difficulty adjustment system that utilised a fully custom behaviour tree to adjust the enemies behaviours to match the players actions

areas of developement worked on included: 
- AI
- Behaviour trees
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Json file management
